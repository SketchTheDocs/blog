[@SketchTheDocs](https://twitter.com/sketchthedocs) is a project to explore visual storytelling as a tool to learn, and teach, complex technology concepts. I'm motivated by two stats:
 
  * [65% of humans are visual learners](https://www.inc.com/molly-reynolds/how-to-spot-visual-auditory-and-kinesthetic-learni.html). We absorb information by sight, detecting patterns and making connections that can improve our retention and recall of what we learn.
  * [One third of students are visual-spatial learners](https://www.gifteddevelopment.org/visual-spatial). We think in pictures, and can learn better when we see "the big picture" (concept or workflow) before we dive into the details.

## Visual Storytelling

Visual storytelling is about using illustrations, colors, fonts and composition, to present information in ways that can support visual and visual-spatial learners. I view it in two contexts. First, as a _communication skill_ (like public speaking or technical writing) that lets you convey complex ideas using visual cues and vocabulary. Second, as a _content creation tool_ that lets you to use those skills to learn, or teach, complex concepts to diverse audiences. 

A visual storytelling toolkit can include many skills like:

  * [Doodling](http://sunnibrown.com/the-doodle-revolution) | developing a visual vocabulary and consistent sketching style that enhances spoken or written content and communications.
  
  * [Sketchnoting](https://creately.com/blog/education/visual-note-taking/) | using those skills to capture, summarize, and synthesize, large amounts of information into a  visual, in real-time. 
  
  * [Anthropomorphism](https://explain.ninja/blog/6-tips-for-effective-animated-video-storytelling/) | adding human traits to visual objects, employing a known storytelling device to build connection with audiences.

  * [Visual Metaphors](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/perspectives/leadership-insights/designers-create-change-visual-metaphors/) | applying familiar mental models to reimagine complex concepts, enabling thw audience to transfer knowledge.
