Over the past year, I've been on a journey of exploration and experimentation of _visual storytelling_ in tech contexts. This is the site I've always wanted to have, to share those learnings and outcomes! Welcome - and I hope you will join me and build your own visual storytelling projects and learning paths.

## Backstory

I've always taking handwritten notes to capture and remember things I've read and learned - but it wasn't till I started attending developer conferences that I saw this as both a self-care tactic and a networking tool. More recently, I've exploring this as a content and communications tool to support learners.

🎙 Want to learn more about the how and why of my journey? Listen to my June 24 conversation on the [Embedded.FM Podcast](https://embedded.fm/episodes/378) where I talk at length about this.

## Purpose

With #SketchTheDocs, I had two main purposes: making visual storytelling a desirable _communication skill_ (that anyone can learn), and building _learning content_ (using visual toolkits) to make complex technology concepts easier to understand and recall for all audiences.
