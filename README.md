# SketchTheDocs

The _SketchTheDocs_ initiative is about exploring visual storytelling for tech from two perspectives:

 * #VisualizeIT = talks and workshops where you `Learn To Sketch`
 * #SketchTheDocs = content and tools where you `Sketch To Learn`

 This repository hosts the source and static site content for the blog published at https://sketchthedocs.dev which describes the initiative in more detail.
